This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for Stargood
Translations' English translation project for the PC-Engine game Zero4 Champ.

                    ****************************************

The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the
code is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of
effort. You'll need GCC, libpng, and ImageMagick (the "convert" utility), as
well as any dependencies of wla-dx.

You'll first need a ROM image of Zero4 Champ for the PC-Engine. It should match
the following specifications:

  No-Intro name: Zero4 Champ (Japan) (V1.5).pce
  CRC32:         b77f2e2f
  MD5:           cf51006c86541b94e8305f456c4d47c5
  SHA-1:         2b664760931cc6011d31cae310410dab7cba2067

Note that you MUST specifically use the later "V1.5" revision of the game; the
original release definitely will not work with this build system, as data in
the kernel bank was shifted around in the newer version due to the added header
message.

Rename this file to "zero4.pce" and copy it into the "zero4" directory. Then:

$ cd zero4
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated ROM
as "zero4_build.pce".

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

Note that translated game text is taken from the file
"zero4/script/en/script.csv". Those who are familiar with the structure of
older projects I've done may notice the absence of any ODS file that can
be downconverted to this CSV. This is because we switched to a more robust
web-based editing system that obviated the need for manually editing individual
files. As such, this CSV is the first and final input file to the script
building process.

While the loss of the manually-formatted files used by the old system is
regrettable, the advantages were simply too great to ignore. If you want to
edit the script, you should convert "script/en/script_deduplicated.csv" (which
contains all the same data as the regular script.csv, but with duplicate text
stored using cell aliases) to your preferred high-level spreadsheet format and
apply whatever formatting you wish to make it look prettier. You can also delete
the column containing JSON-formatted data, as this is only used by the online
editor and isn't part of the local build process.
